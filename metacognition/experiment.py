# create experiment to evaluate bug insertion diversity
# between usage of BugLibrary and base model when asked
# to insert a bug into code. Diversity can be evaluated as
# the line numbers which were modified, the type of bug
# inserted (can be identified via GPT-prompt), other metrics
# that I can ask ChatGPT about such as # chars changed and stuff.
